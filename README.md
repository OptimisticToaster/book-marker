# book-marker
Bookmark Manager

A website bookmark manager.

## Structure

Initially, it will be arranged for JavaScript and JSON data files, so very lean. I expect to create a new branch later (or possible fork) that goes to Python and maybe SQLite.

## Functionality

Present a single-page interface to saved bookmarks. A collabsible tree structure seems like the best option so far.
